                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayer at temperatures exceeding 30&#8451;(86&#8457;),when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>

            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?

            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dannces. To answer your quetsion, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            <dl>
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>A little knowm but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
                <dt>Icelandic briwnian shuffle</dt>
                <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means og getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, around
                shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he tought this dance inspired mordern style such as twerking.
                </dd>
                <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960 believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on howeverit was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
